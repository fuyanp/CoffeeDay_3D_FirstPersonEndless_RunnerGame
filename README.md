# CoffeeDay_3D_FirstPersonEndless_RunnerGame
#### Course Project

#### The playerâ€™s aim is to run as far as they possibly can across three lines in coffee shop and collect more coffee before they get caught by the sleep monster in order to achieve a high score, which they can then try to beat. This game flow is inspired by subway surfers game, and plan to be implemented by using unreal engine.
